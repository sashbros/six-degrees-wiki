# Six Degrees of WikiPedia

Six Degrees of WikiPedia is all about finding the shortest path between any two WikiPedia pages. It is based on the fact that all wiki pages are six or fewer connections (hyperlinks on the wiki page) away from each other.
As a result, a chain of connections can be made to connect any two wiki pages in a maximum of six steps, if possible.
It is inspired by the idea of [Six degrees of separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation) and the [original creation](https://www.sixdegreesofwikipedia.com/).
